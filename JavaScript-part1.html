            <h1>JavaScript</h1>
        </div>

        <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
        <p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>, also called JS, is a
            flexible and powerful language that is implemented consistently
            by various web browsers, making it the language for web development.
            JavaScript, HTML, and CSS are the core components of web technology.
            While HTML is responsible for structure and CSS is responsible for style,
            JavaScript provides interactivity to web pages in the browser. (The link has tutorials for beginners,
            Intermediate and advanced javaScript users.)</p>

        <div class="javaScript-1">
            <h3>Console</h3>
        </div>

        <ul>
            <li>The console is a panel that displays important messages, like errors, for developers.</li>
            <li>In JavaScript, the console keyword refers to an object, a collection of data and actions, that we can
                use in our code.</li>
            <li> <b>Keyowrds</b>are words that are built into the JavaScript language, so the computer will recognize
                them and treats them specially.</li>
            <li>One action, or method, that is built into the console object is the <i>.log()</i> method. When we write
                console.log() what we put inside the parentheses will get printed, or logged, to the console.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Comments</h3>
        <p>When collaborating it is better to leave comments for ourselves and other developers.
            As we write JavaScript, we can write comments in our code that will ignore as our program runs.
            These comments exist just for human readers.
        </p>
        <p>Comments can explain what the code is doing, leave instructions for developers using the code,
            or add any other useful annotations.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A <i> single line comment</i>will comment out a single line and is denoted with two forward slashes //
                preceding it.
                You can also us ea single line comment to comment after a line of code.</li>
            <li>A multi-line comment will comment out multiple lines and is denoted with /* to begin the comment, and */
                to end the comment.
                You can also use this syntax to comment something out in the middle of a line of code.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Data Types</h3>
        <p>Data types are the classifications we give to the different kinds of data that we use in programming.
            In JavaScript, there are seven fundamental data types:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Number: Any number, including numbers with decimals: 4, 8, 1516, 23.42.</li>
            <li>String: Any grouping of characters on your keyboard (letters, numbers, spaces, symbols, etc.)
                surrounded by single quotes: ' ... ' or double quotes " ... ". Though we prefer single quotes.
                Some people like to think of string as a fancy word for text.</li>
            <li>Boolean: This data type only has two possible values— either true or false (without quotes).
                It’s helpful to think of booleans as on and off switches or as the answers to a “yes” or “no” questio
            </li>
            <li>Null: This data type represents the intentional absence of a value, and is represented by the keyword
                null (without quotes).</li>
            <li>Undefined: This data type is denoted by the keyword undefined (without quotes).
                It also represents the absence of a value though it has a different use than null.</li>
            <li>Symbol: A newer feature to the language, symbols are unique identifiers, useful in more complex coding.
                No need to worry about these for now.</li>
            <li>Object: Collections of related data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The first 6 of those types are considered primitive data types. They are the most basic data types in the
            language.</p>

        <h3>Arithmetic Operators</h3>
        <p> JavaScript has several built-in arithmetic operators, that allow us to perform mathematical calculations on
            numbers.
            These include the following operators and their corresponding symbols:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Add: +</li>
            <li>Subtract: -</li>
            <li>Multiply: *</li>
            <li>Divide: /</li>
            <li>Remainder(modulo): %</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The remainder operator, sometimes called modulo, returns the number that remains after the
            right-hand number divides into the left-hand number as many times as it evenly can: 11 % 3
            equals 2 because 3 fits into 11 three times, leaving 2 as the remainder.</p>

        <h3>String Concatenation</h3>
        <p>When a + operator is used on two strings, it appends the right string to the left string. This process of
            appending one
            strong to another is called <i>Concatenation</i>.
        </p>
        <p>Examples:<br />
            console.log('hi' + 'ya'); // Prints 'hiya'
            console.log('wo' + 'ah'); // Prints 'woah'
            console.log('I love to ' + 'code.')
            // Prints 'I love to code.'</p>
        <p>Notice in the third example we had to make sure to include a space at the end of the first string. The
            computer will join the strings exactly,
            so we needed to make sure to include the space we wanted between the two strings.</p>

        <h3>Properties</h3>
        <p>When you introduce a new piece of data into a JavaScript program,
            the browser saves it as an instance of the data type.
            Every string instance has a property called length that stores the number of characters
            in that string. You can retrieve property information by appending the string with a period
            and the property name:</p>
        <p>console.log('Hello'.length); // Prints 5</p>

        <h3>Methods</h3>
        <p>Remember that methods are actions we can perform. JavaScript provides a number of string methods.</p>
        <p>We call, or use, these methods by appending an instance with:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>a period (the dot operator)</li>
            <li>The name of the method</li>
            <li>opening and closing parentheses</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Example: <br />
            console.log('hello'.toUpperCase()); // Prints 'HELLO'
            console.log('Hey'.startsWith('H')); // Prints true</p>
        <p>You can find a list of built-in string methogds here at this <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String">MDN
                article</a></p>

        <h3>Built-in Objects</h3>
        <p>Other built-in objects can be found <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String">here</a>
        </p>
        <p>The greatest thing about objects is that they have methods.</p>
        <p>Example:<br />
            console.log(Math.random()); // Prints a random number between 0 and 1</p>
        <p>To see all of the properties and methods on the <i>Math</i>obect, take a look at the <a
